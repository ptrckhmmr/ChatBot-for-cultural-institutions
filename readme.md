# Chatbot: Overview of folder structure

The GitLab repository is divided into four different parts:

 1. **Chatbot debugging version** (including instructions for creating additional intents)
 2. **Chatbot deployment version** (only essential components including docker files)
 3. **Utilities** (help functions for creating training data, entity mappings and knowledge bases)
 4. **Seminar paper**

In each of these folders (except for the seminar paper) there is a separate readme.md file specifying the usage.
